# Ageing signs detection
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect visible signs of aging in facial images such as wrinkles, puffy eyes, dark spots, or a clear face. It includes training a model on labeled data, performing data augmentation, and testing using Haar-cascade-based face detection and class activation predictions.
